### Background
Seraph was a passion project I started in 2019 with [Kay](https://github.com/Clemintina), and since then have stopped development on. <br />
This is a remake and cleanup of the original mod we created, with more features, cleaner structure, and faster responses. <br />
***Special thanks to [yabqy](https://github.com/yabqy) and [Directives](https://github.com/DirectivesMods) for the help on the original TabStats mod <3***
